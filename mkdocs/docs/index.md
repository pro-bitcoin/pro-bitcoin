# Welcome to Pro Bitcoin!
A guided **code** tour of [bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin) with the help of [prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and [dashboards](https://grafana.pro-bitcoin.io/d/qtQCmdN7z/blocks?orgId=1&refresh=5m):

## What

**Pro Bitcoin** = <span class="red">pro</span>metheus enabled <span class="red">bitcoin</span> node

## Why
If you are like me, you have a curiosity of how systems operate in the wild. Bitcoin nodes play a critical part in consensus. But how does it really work?
I learn by tinkering or [f**king](https://www.tiktok.com/@rogerskaer/video/7147844411915783470?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7161381407897601541) around.
Upon examining bitcoin-core code,  I felt runtime visibility over time was lacking.
There are debug logs but our ability to see trends is limited.

## How
This site provides links to critical code operations along with visuals.
Graphs are generated by using Prometheus, a metrics library that exposes internal state using [counters](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/), timers and gauges (amount others). Paired with Grafana, a flexible graphical charting tool, one can easily see trends in your own node.
I [forked](https://github.com/pro-bitcoin/pro-bitcoin) bitcoin-core and [patched](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pro-bitcoin/pro-bitcoin/prometheus/patch-v24.txt) it to include [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)

## Who

So who is this for? Experienced developers mostly, but that isn't a must. Nor is it required to understand `C++`. Cryptography is not discussed at all, so don't worry about that.
In general this is a reference site for the curious. 

## What's Next?
Check out [bitcoin contrib](/contrib) for information on bitcoin-core contributing and core concepts.

Want to run your own prometheus bitcoin node? Check out [install](/install) docs.
